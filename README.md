# Decoding Nature Final Project
[Code Version 1](https://github.com/SalamaAlmheiri/DecodingNature/blob/main/DN_V1.pde)

### Idea:

- My idea is to make an interactive program that would take an input image and turn it into an "artwork" by using pieces of the image, duplicating them and rotating them.  
- I will be using Processing.
- To make it interactive, I want to make the user/viewer be able to easily input their own image (from their phone maybe?) which will turn into an artwork. Every user and their image will have a different outcome which I am interested in seeing.

### Problem:
- I do not know how to make the viewer have the ability to send their image directly to processing.
